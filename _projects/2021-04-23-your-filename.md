## Abstract

The objective of this report is to compare the use of classification models and regression models from Machine and Deep Learning are used to predict the price trend of a stock. In this report the stock that is used is the Koninklijke KPN N.V. (KPN) stock from the Amsterdam Exchange (AEX) Index. Technical features and the price of 4 other stocks from the AEX Index are used to train 12 models. The 12 models are 6 regression and 6 classification
