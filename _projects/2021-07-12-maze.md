> In order to figure out how to traverse a maze through code, we first need to understand what depth-first search is. Depth-first search (sometimes referred to in this article as DFS) is a graph/tree traversal algorithm that follows a path as far as it can until it either, reaches the goal or has nowhere else to go. It’s almost like running as far as you can in one direction until you hit a wall. Hopefully that analogy helps clear up any lingering confusion. You might even be starting to see how we can use Depth-First Search to solve a maze!
Before we dive into the algorithm itself there are a few things we need to understand about depth-first search first. There are many approaches and styles to implementing a depth-first search algorithm and a lot of those implementation choices will entirely depend on the problem you’re trying to solve.
