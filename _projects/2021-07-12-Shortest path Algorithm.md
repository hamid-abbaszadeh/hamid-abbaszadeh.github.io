# Introduction

Blind search algorithms such as breadth-first and depth-first exhaust all possibilities; starting from the given node, they iterate over all possible paths until they reach the goal node. These algorithms run in O(V+E), or linear time, where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges between vertices.

However, it is not necessary to examine all possible paths. Algorithms such as Greedy, Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, and A* eliminate paths either using educated guesses(heuristics) or distance from source to node V to find the optimal path. By eliminating impossible paths, these algorithms can achieve time complexities as low as O(E log(V)).
